I am a passionate data analyst with a keen eye for detail and a drive for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. My goal is to leverage data to drive informed decision-making and contribute to business success.

With over 9+ years of experience in the customer success field and customer service, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis, combining my expertise in coaching with analytical skills. I have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Pitzer College, one of the Claremont Colleges, and I am a recent graduate from the Business Intelligence Professional program from TripleTen Online Bootcamp (formally known as Practicum Online Bootcamp).

In my professional journey, I have developed a strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools such as Tableau. I am experienced in conducting exploratory data analysis, identifying trends, and providing actionable insights.

Beyond my technical skills, I am a dedicated and organized professional, adept at managing projects and collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams. I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments, where I can apply my problem-solving abilities and communication skills to drive impactful outcomes.

Outside of work, you can find me coaching tennis, playing golf, exploring new delicious food finds, or doing something fitness related.

I am excited about the endless possibilities that data analysis offers and the potential to make a meaningful impact through data-driven decision-making. If you're interested in collaboration or have any questions, feel free to reach out.
